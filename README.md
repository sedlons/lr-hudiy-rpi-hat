Functions:
 - self power control with latch-up
 - steering wheel resistance button read
 - power control of RPi
 - rotary encoder (volume)

 - heater power on by timing with RTC (NOT IMPLEMENTED IN HUDIY YET)
 - webasto RX/TX interface (NOT TESTED YET)

Python code is used for communicating between HUDIY and arduino.

Old project name was lr-openauto-hat, because first version was used with OpenAuto.
